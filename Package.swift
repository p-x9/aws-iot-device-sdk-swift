    // aws-sdk-swift is only used in test targets to help with setup and cleanup of testing service clients
    // We use "aws-iot-device-sdk-swift-testing-branch" to maintain aws-crt-swift version pairity between it
    // and our SDK for testing. As aws-sdk-swift depends on swift-smithy, which also uses aws-crt-swift, we
    // keep the versions in sync using a fork https://github.com/sbSteveK/smithy-swift
    // Steps for updating the versions:
    //    1. Update crt version for smithy-swift
    //        a. fork from https://github.com/sbSteveK/smithy-swift.git
    //        b. pull in latest https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-swift and update aws-crt-swift version in `Package.swift`
    //        c. create a PR to sbSteveK/smithy, and submit for @sbstevek to review and merge
    //        d. go to latest Package.swift from awslabs/aws-crt-swift, and look for `clientRuntimeVersion`. This is the version tag of smithy-swift that aws-sdk-swift is using.
    //        e. cut a release in sbSteveK/smithy using the same version tag as `clientRuntimeVersion`
    //    2. Update crt version for https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift
    //        a. branch from "aws-iot-device-sdk-swift-testing-branch"
    //        b. pull in the latest main and update crt version as needed
    //        c. submit PR against "aws-iot-device-sdk-swift-testing-branch" for review and merge
    // Once the PRs are merged, you can update the version here for aws-crt-swift, remember to test locally to make sure the Package.swift resolves correctly.
